# AetherAI - Agentic AI Software Engineer


> **Note:** This project is in an early development stage. Many features are still being implemented. Contributions are welcome!

## 🚀 About

**AetherAI** is an advanced AI-powered software engineer designed to understand high-level human instructions, break them down into structured steps, research relevant information, and generate functional code to achieve a given objective.

Leveraging **large language models, advanced planning algorithms, and web browsing capabilities**, AetherAI acts as an intelligent AI pair programmer that helps automate and accelerate software development tasks.

### 🌟 Why AetherAI? 
- Automate complex coding tasks with minimal guidance.
- Research, plan, and execute software development workflows.
- Enhance productivity with AI-assisted debugging and optimization.
- Open-source alternative to proprietary AI coding agents.

> **Inspired by [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin) by Cognition AI.** AetherAI aims to match and surpass Devin's performance on the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) benchmarks.
